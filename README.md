## Introduction

In this project I have taken Iris Flower Data set to do the basic research for Data Analysis. 

## Fisher's Iris Data
# 
The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems" as an example of linear discriminant analysis.

It was actually called as Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson who collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. In relation to the accuracy of the data it said that two types of species were collected from the same land, picked on the same day and mearusred at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus.

This famous iris data set gives the measurements in centimeters of the variables sepal length and width and petal length and width, respectively, for 50 flowers from each of 3 species of iris. The species are Iris setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.

The dataset contains a set of 150 records under 5 attributes -

1. sepal length in cm 
2. sepal width in cm 
3. petal length in cm 
4. petal width in cm 
5. Species: 
    - Setosa 
    - Versicolour 
    - Virginica

## Libraries Used
Importing the libaries for this project: Pandas, Numpy, Holoviews.

Pandas is an open source, BSD-licensed library providing high-performance, easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools.

NumPy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python


import pandas as pd

import numpy as np

import seaborn as sns


# # Data
Import the Irisdataset.csv using the panda library and examine first 10 rows of dataset

Iris_data = pd.read_csv('attachments/Irisdataset.csv')

Iris_data.columns = ['sepal_length', 'sepal_width' , 'petal_length', 'petal_width', 'species']

# specify the number of rows to be showen here

Iris_data.head(10)

Out:

![Iris_data_Head](/attachments/Iris_head.png)

# Discovering the Shape of the table

Iris_data.shape

Out:(150, 5)

# Figure out unique type of Iris flower and the size

Iris_data['species'].unique()

Out:

array(['setosa', 'versicolor', 'virginica'], dtype=object)

Iris_data['species'].value_counts()

Out:

virginica     50

setosa        50

versicolor    50

Name: species, dtype: int64

# Analysing the data using Min, Max, Mean, Median and Standard Deviation

In this section, I have included few functions from Computations / Descriptive Stats of DataFrame

Get the minimum value of all the column in the data set

Iris_data.min()
Out:
sepal_length       4.3
sepal_width          2
petal_length         1
petal_width        0.1
species         setosa
dtype: object

Iris_data.max()
Out:
sepal_length          7.9
sepal_width           4.4
petal_length          6.9
petal_width           2.5
species         virginica
dtype: object

Iris_data.mean()
Out:
sepal_length    5.843333
sepal_width     3.057333
petal_length    3.758000
petal_width     1.199333
dtype: float64

Iris_data.median()
Out:
sepal_length    5.80
sepal_width     3.00
petal_length    4.35
petal_width     1.30
dtype: float64

Iris_data.std()
Out:
sepal_length    0.828066
sepal_width     0.435866
petal_length    1.765298

# Summary statistics of the Iris_data Dataframe 
DataFrame.describe: Generates descriptive statistics that summarize the central tendency, dispersion and shape of a datasetâ€™s distribution, excluding NaN values.

# Describing all columns of a DataFrame regardless of data type

Iris_data.describe(include='all')
