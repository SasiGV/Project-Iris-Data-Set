## Introduction

In this project I have taken Iris Flower Data set to do the basic research for Data Analysis. 

## Fisher's Iris Data
# 
The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper "The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems" as an example of linear discriminant analysis.

It was actually called as Anderson's Iris data set because Edgar Anderson who collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. In relation to the accuracy of the data it said that two types of species were collected from the same land, picked on the same day and mearusred at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus.

This famous iris data set gives the measurements in centimeters of the variables sepal length and width and petal length and width, respectively, for 50 flowers from each of 3 species of iris. The species are Iris setosa, versicolor, and virginica. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.

The dataset contains a set of 150 records under 5 attributes -

1. sepal length in cm 
2. sepal width in cm 
3. petal length in cm 
4. petal width in cm 
5. Species: 
# -- Setosa 
# -- Versicolour 
# -- Virginica
